Online Round (Aptitude+Coding) : (2:00 hrs)
Students of all branches were allowed to appear in the online round.15 MCQs only on aptitude for the first half an hour and 15 MCQs on basis of C,C++,OS for the second half an hour and followed by a coding question to be solved in the next one hour.There was no negative marking. The aptitude questions were really good given the time limit. The test was conducted on Hacker  Rank. Compilers for coding were not allowed.The MCQs section carried 60 marks and 40 marks for one coding question.Coding Question : Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible.Return the minimum difference.Interview 1(FTF):
